# Documentation for the Text Editor Project

## Introduction
This is a simple text editor program built with Python and the Tkinter module. It allows users to create, open, and save text files, as well as undo and redo changes made to the text.

## Installation
The program requires Python 3.x and the Tkinter module. If you are using an IDE like PyCharm, you may already have both installed. Otherwise, you can download Python from the official website `(https://www.python.org/downloads/)` and install it. Tkinter should be included with most Python installations.

## Usage
To use the text editor, simply run the program using a Python interpreter or IDE. A window will appear containing the text editor interface.

### Creating a New File
To create a new file, click on **File** in the menu bar and select **New**. This will clear the text editor window, and you can begin typing your new text.

### Opening a File
To open an existing file, click on **File** in the menu bar and select **Open** . This will open a file dialog window, where you can browse your computer's files and select the text file you want to open. Once you select a file, its contents will be displayed in the text editor window.

### Saving a File
To save a file, click on **File** in the menu bar and select **Save**. If you have not yet saved the file, a file dialog window will appear, allowing you to choose a file name and location to save the file. If the file has already been saved, the changes you have made will be saved to the same file location.

### Undo and Redo
The text editor includes undo and redo functionality. To undo a change, click on **Edit** in the menu bar and select **Undo**. To redo a change, click on **Edit** and select **Redo**. These options will only be available if there are changes to undo or redo.

### Dark Mode
The text editor includes a dark mode option. To toggle between light and dark mode, click on "View" in the menu bar and select **Toggle Dark Mode**. When dark mode is enabled, the background of the text editor window and the status bar will change to a dark gray color, while the text color will change to white.

### Status Bar
The status bar displays the number of words and lines in the text editor. It updates automatically as you type, delete, or modify the text.

## Conclusion
The text editor is a simple but useful program for creating and editing text files. It provides basic features such as creating, opening, and saving files, as well as undo and redo functionality. Additionally, it includes a dark mode option and a status bar to keep track of the text's length.
